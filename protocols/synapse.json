	"filler_permissionlessness_details": "Synapse does not provide documentation or reference code for running a Filler. Contract code suggests addresses claiming and filling orders have to be whitelisted by the protocol.",

	"censorship_resistance_details": "Only a protocol run filler can fill orders due to restrictions imposed within the contract to whitelist fillers.",
	"filler_failure_resistance": "Average",
	"filler_failure_resistance_details": "If an order remains unfulfilled for a short period, there is a short dispute window which theoretically allows an order to be refunded after a 7 day delay period. Only addresses with a special desputer permission can initiate this process."
