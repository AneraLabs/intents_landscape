	"auction_design_ranking": "Average",
	"auction_design_details": "The first accepted solver bid automatically wins the auction irrespective of whether another bid comes in at roughly the same time with a better price or outcome for the user",
	"auction_openness": "Excellent",
	"auction_openness_details": "Auctions occur entirely on chain with no auction period of shielded competition window",
	"filler_diversity": "Good",
	"filler_diversity_details": "Protocol acts as it's own solver but also allows for others to permissionlessly fill orders",
	"censorship_resistance": "Good",
	"censorship_resistance_details": "As auctions are entirely on chain, all details about new orders are public and available to all participants. There are no mechanisms on-chain by which the protocol can prevent an order from being accepted. There are however no penalties to fillers for systematically ignoring address or orders which can indirectly result in censorship. However to prevent this there only needs to be one honest rational filler in the ecosystem to fill the order.",
	"filler_failure_resistance": "Poor",
	"filler_failure_resistance_details": "If no fillers are available there is no way to fill an order and no way for the user to get their funds back on the source chain."
