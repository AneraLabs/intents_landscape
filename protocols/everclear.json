    "description": "Everclear is a novel public good mechanism for settling intents across chains.",
    "mainnet": "yes",
    "type": "bridge",
    "chains_supported": "Enables permissionless expansion to new chains and rollups, making it possible for any application on any chain to onboard users from any other chain.",
    "xchain_sync": "Canonical bridges for message passing",
    "auction_design": "RTB",
    "auction_design_ranking": "Good",
    "auction_design_details": "Race to the Bottom. Auctioneer smart contract governs filler selection (by honoring the bid with the lowest fees).",
    "auction_openness": "Excellent",
    "auction_openness_details": "Everclear uses a smart contract for auctions which allows open access for anyone to review the process.",
    "filler_permissionlessness": "Excellent",
    "filler_permissionlessness_details": "Everclear supports direct integration of filler networks and makes no assumptions about signaling, discovery, matching, or execution of intents. Any filler can participate provided they have sufficient balance stored on-chain.",
    "censorship_resistance": "Average",
    "censorship_resistance_details": "While a lot of components including auctioner are on chain, there are still off-chain components that can in theory be censored: Relayers and Cartographer.",
    "filler_failure_resistance": "Good",
    "filler_failure_resistance_details": "If no filler bids, users can increase the fees on their intent. If the winning filler fails to execute within a predefined time window, the intent will be open to any other filler who will take the MAX_FEE as defined by the protocol plus any added fees."
