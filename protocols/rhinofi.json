    "filler_failure_resistance": "Average",
    "filler_failure_resistance_details": "Since the only running filler belongs to the protocol, were this or the off-chain infra to fail there would be no way for a user to complete a bridging operation. rhino.fi is built on StarkEx which provides some mechanism for users to withdraw funds to Ethereum L1 in the event the operator goes offline providing some limited recovery options."
